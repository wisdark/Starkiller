## Build and run from source
Prerequisites:
* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 10+.
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
Currently it has been tested using Yarn 1.22.0.
```
yarn install
```

### Compile and hot-reload for development
```
yarn electron:serve
```

### Compile and minify for production
```
yarn electron:build

# Or to target a specific OS.
yarn electron:build:lin
yarn electron:build:win
yarn electron:build:mac
```


Starkiller's build tool, [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build), is not meant to target multiple platforms in a single build. It is also recommended to compile on your target platform. 
For example, to build for amd64 (on an amd64 machine) with an AppImage, the command would be:
```
yarn electron:build --arm64 --linux AppImage
```

**Note:** To regenerate the icons
```
npm install -g electron-icon-builder
yarn electron:generate-icons
```

## Compatability Table
Starkillerâ€™s new features occasionally depend on new functionality within Empire. Therefore, it is recommended that you follow this release table for syncing up your Starkiller and Empire versions. If you are using an older version of Empire, Starkiller will warn you when logging in, but will allow you to continue. If a there is a new minimum version of Empire required to get all the features out of Starkiller, we will do a minor version bump to Starkiller.
| Starkiller Release | Minimum Empire Version | Notes  |
| ------------------ | ---------------------- | ------ |
| 1.0.x              | 3.1.1         | 3.1.1 is the first version of Empire to include all the user endpoints necessary for Starkiller to function |
| 1.1.x              | 3.1.5         | 3.1.5 updated the reporting endpoint to have the same result as running it in the CLI. Starkiller 1.1.x uses that reporting endpoint for the reporting tab |
| 1.2.x              | 3.2.0         | 3.2.0 added an endpoint for users that is needed for the UI updates introduced in Starkiller 1.2.0
| 1.3.x              | 3.3.0         | 3.3.0 categorized all of the modules in Empire with corresponding [MITRE techniques](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/enterprise/)
| 1.4.x, 1.5.x              | 3.5.0         | 3.5.0 added real-time notifications for new listeners and agents
| 1.6.x, 1.7.x              | 3.7.0         | 1.6.0 was tested against Empire 3.7.0. There *shouldn't* be any breaking changes, but there were a lot of code changes.
| 1.8.x             | 4.0.0         |
